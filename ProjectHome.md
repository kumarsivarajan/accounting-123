Forks is the road:
One of the main reasons why there is no Firefox for Accounting and Business systems is because the taxation, accounting regulations, payroll and hundreds of other small core items are so different for different regions of even the same country.

Accounting-123 has been developed with all this in mind and could reasonably easily be adapted to your region by yourself or your organization.

Development is divided into two main sections:

1. The main project, which you must please contribute look and feel, navigation and cosmetic as well as other related improvements

2. The core system files, which is specific to your region. The core functionality is completely developed and finished and only security and functional improvements and changes are expected

Unlike many Open Source projects, I expect you to fork the software, I want you to create your own version so that it will be maintained by you for your region and with git (thanks Linus) it is possible to work backwards as well as forwards with commits and to do push etc.

Developmental roadmap of core 2012:
  * Replace deprecated PHP to run on PHP 5.3
  * Various Security issues
  * Improvement in Look & feel, graphics, css, etc
  * Reduce 'clunkyness' preload data more intuitive user response
  * Your input???
